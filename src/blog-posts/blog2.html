          <p>
            This week was the first full week with my group. We decided to make a Slack group so that we could easily communicate and figure out our next steps.
            We began with making a list of requirements for the problem that we were presented with by the client.
            This boiled down to making a program that the client could easily input counts of people from the room at the beginning, middle, and end of talks.
            We also decided that we needed a way to store the data, and a way for the data to be presented to the client.
            The client also needs a way to specify which session the count is for.
          </p>

          <p>
            After this, we focused on getting our Github repository set up. I made the repository for us and added everyone as a collaborator.
            We now have an easy way to share code in a repository. We also decided on using a git branching strategy.
            This forces all changes to the code base to be pull requested and then code reviewed by two people on the team before being merged.
            I think this will help ensure that our code quality remains high and we can all help each other out.
          </p>

          <p>
            For next week, we are planning on meeting on Monday to discuss more about our requirements and figure out some features to go along with them.
            We also want to share our strengths and weaknesses so we can allocate talent efficiently.
          </p>

          <p>
            My goal for next week is to have a really well thought out strategy for how our workflow should look.
            I would also like to have our requirements and features mostly pinned down so we can begin thinking about our implementation.
          </p>

          <p>
            All in all, I think this was a very productive week for our team and we are off to a good start.
