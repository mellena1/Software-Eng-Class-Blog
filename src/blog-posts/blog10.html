          <p>
            This week, our team had a few obstacles to overcome. A few team members were sick, and some just did not show up. Despite this, the rest of the team tried to accomplish as much as they could.
          </p>

          <p>
            I focused on trying to improve our code quality for phase 1 in the frontend this week. Currently, it is pretty messy, and we have bugs that are hard to track down because of that. I decided it would be best to replace a lot of our code with an external library for the table. Our table code worked for the most part, but was messy and tough to read. We will lose some time on me having to switch everything over to this library, but I think it will save time on fixing bugs in our current code base.
          </p>

          <p>
            No progress was made on phase 3, so that is beginning to look like more of a pipe dream at this point. Phase 2 is slowly coming along, and I think we will be able to finish it by the due date, as we allocated more people to it.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am now the only person working on phase 1, so I am hoping to clean it up as much as I can and as quickly as I can. After that, I will try to help out as much as I can with the other phases.
          </p>

          <p>
            I think we are still pacing well to finish at least phase 2. I think that is a realistic goal to set. If we finish more than that, that would be even better.
