          <p>
            This week our team tried to accomplish our goal that we set last week, which was to get all of phase one done. We unfortunately were unable to reach our goal, but we did get close. We as the backend team were able to finish all of the API calls we needed to get done, which was our goal. Our UI team were not able to get the UI done though, so we did not have a functioning application.
          </p>

          <p>
            The UI team had most of the functionality working to collect data from the database, just not to add, edit, or delete anything in the database. We decided that Charles from the backend team would move over to help the UI team finish everything up, and the backend team would focus on starting phase two. Our goal for that is to figure out the database schema for the count table, and to come up with some basic drawings for the counting interface.
          </p>

          <p>
            This goal seems very achievable for our team, as the backend team has been working really well together. We will probably have plenty of time to even start coding after that, and get very ahead. This will help the team overall, as after that we can focus the entire team on making a great UI.
          </p>

          <p>
            Looking forward, I think we are on track enough to finish the project by the end of the semester. If we have a week of entirely focusing on this project, we will be fine.
          </p>
