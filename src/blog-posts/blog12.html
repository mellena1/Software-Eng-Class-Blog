            This week, our group presented our application's final state. To get there, we worked all of this past week to make sure that everything was functional and clean. Phase 3 was implemented completely over the last few days, and it came out very nice. We even got it working on both mobile and desktop. I finished up phase 1 and figured out all of the bugs that I was encountering at first.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the last week I was also able to make error messages for phase 1, which was fun to learn how to use. That also polished up the UI a lot.
          </p>

          <p>
            I think overall our team built a really great application. It really came together in the last month or so, and seeing it working at the end made the work worth it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Learning Angular over the course of this project was really great, as I had not done much web development before this. I had a little bit of Typescript experience before this, but getting to use it in a full framework was really interesting.
          </p>

          <p>
            I also had never used Go to interact with a database, so that was really cool to learn.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, I am glad to have had this experience to learn a lot and implement a full application.
