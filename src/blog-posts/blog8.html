            Following on our plan from last week, part of the team worked on finishing up phase 1, while some of us from the backend team worked on starting phase 2. This involved figuring out how to structure the data for counts in the database, designing the UI for phase 2, and discussing who will work on adding count API calls to the backend.
          </p>

          <p>
            We completed most of these tasks, and were able to add the schema information to our SQL schema code. Adam focused on designing the UI, which he did a very good job on. We also decided that Brad and Kenny will be the ones mostly focusing on the backend code.
          </p>

          <p>
            I ended up spending a lot of my time this week helping out the rest of the team get phase 1 finished. I was expecting to work mostly on pushing phase 2 forward, but the phase 1 team ended up needing a decent amount of help, so I went back to step in. I helped both in fixing bugs that they found in the backend and also helping them with some of the Typescript on the frontend. That ended up working really well because they know a lot more about making UI elements in Angular, while I feel much more comfortable working on the Typescript.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the next week, we must finish phase 1. I decided to dedicate almost all of my time to making sure that phase 1 is finished. The UI team decided that they needed someone with more Typescript experience, so I volunteered to be the person to help out with that. I think we will easily be able to finish that. The rest of the backend team will be working on getting phase 2 started.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although we are a little behind where I wanted to be at this point, I think we are still on track to finish the project by the deadline based on the speed that we were working at this past week.
