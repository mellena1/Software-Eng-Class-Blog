          <p>
            My goal for this week was to get the ball rolling on our semester project.
            To reach this goal, this week I focused on learning about requirements. 
            This was a vital topic to learn about early in the semester because it is the best way to start planning for a project.
            Requirements are very important to pin down immediately because if you start implementing before knowing what you need to accomplish, you will end up with a messy code base and a program that didn't solve the problem.
          </p>

          <p>
            A requirement is what the client expects the program to do and what the result should be.
            Requirements should be what you are trying to accomplish, but not how you are accomplishing it.
          </p>

          <p>
            The problems I anticipate to have are getting the initial communication of our group together.
            We also need to figure out our requirements actually are.
            I think these will be our major problems so far as we haven't gotten too far in the project.
          </p>

          <p>
            I think overall I accomplished my goals for this week, as I now understand what requirements are more than I did before.
