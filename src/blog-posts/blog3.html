          <p>
            This week our group met on both Monday and Thursday to start discussing our plans for how to get started.
          </p>

          <p>
            On Monday, we all introduced ourselves and went through what everyone's strengths are, so that we could get a preliminary idea moving forward of who could help with what parts of the project. We also discussed some basic thoughts on what our features should be.
          </p>

          <p>
            On Thursday, we met and came to the conclusion that, to stay agile, we must start working on our first feature so that we can get feedback from the user. This first feature will be the ability for the user to initialize the data of the room and talk information. This will allow our client to start working with our application very early on.
          </p>

          <p>
            Those were our main goals for the week, to figure out what our first steps were on starting the project, and getting an idea on the strengths of our group. I definitely learned some skills on how to talk with such a large group, and what we can improve upon next week. I think for next week we should follow an agenda almost for our Monday meeting, so that we can all get a chance to give our opinions on each topic.
          </p>

          <p>
            One problem I saw this week was that we do not really have anyone with a ton of frontend experience (specifically in web design), so our group may need to learn how to make a good interface on the web on the fly. I do not think this will be a huge problem, as we have a general idea of what we need to do to make that happen, just no specific experience in the area.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am feeling confident in our ability to get a working product of our first phase of work out pretty quickly, so I think we are succeeding in our goals so far. This first phase of getting a working version of the data input feature out will probably be the hardest part of the project, as we need to make everything from scratch. After this we will have our codebase setup for the next phases.
