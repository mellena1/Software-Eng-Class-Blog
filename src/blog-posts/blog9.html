          <p>
            This past week our group was entirely focused on getting phase 1 finished. I would say we did not accomplish the goal of having it "finished", but we did meet the goal of having it functional. I think that is still a step in the right direction. I was assigned to help finish phase 1 in the sense of getting the code cleaner and improving our error handling.
          </p>

          <p>
            We now look forward to getting the rest of the project done. For phase 2, we have the backend set up for the most part. We now just need the UI. I think for phase 3, the backend is mostly set too, we may just need to add some extra calls if the frontend needs them.
          </p>

          <p>
            As for work segmentation, we have decided to split up more for the final stretch now that everyone has a better idea of how the application is put together. We have three people (including myself) working on phase 1, two people working on phase 3's UI and the rest working on phase 2. This gives us enough people to finish phases 1 and 2 but also enough manpower to get far on phase 3.
          </p>

          <p>
            I think we are in a pretty good position to finish the project by the end of the semester. Now that we have more experience with Angular for the UI, I think the frontends will start progressing much faster.
