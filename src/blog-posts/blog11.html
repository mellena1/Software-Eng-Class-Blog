          <p>
            This past week, I focused on finishing the refactor of phase 1. I was able to figure out how to do everything I needed to for the new table library that I decided to implement, so that allowed me to make huge strides this week. Although I was not able to finish completely, I did get all four of our pages for phase 1 refactored and functional. All I need to do now is iron out some bugs and test it all to make sure all of the expected functionality works.
          </p>

          <p>
            The rest of the group made a lot of progress as well. Phase 2 is very close to being done and phase 3 is started and made a lot of progress. Phase 2 was made for a phone screen, and that UI is looking pretty good. Phase 3 is just waiting on a backend call to be implemented. I think our group is in a really good position to have everything done by next week.
          </p>

          <p>
            My work for the next week will be finishing up phase 1's refactor and then helping out with setting our presentation up for next week.
